## 🔄 How It Works: Key Workflows

### **Workflow 1: Vendor Onboarding**
```
1. User registers as CLIENT
2. User applies to become VENDOR (/api/vendors/apply)
3. User submits KYC documents
4. Admin reviews application (/api/admin/vendors/pending)
5. Admin approves/rejects (/api/admin/vendors/[id]/approve)
6. Upon approval, user role changes to VENDOR
7. Vendor can create stores
```

### **Workflow 2: Auction Process**
```
1. Vendor creates auction with start/end times
2. System changes status: SCHEDULED → RUNNING → ENDING_SOON → ENDED
3. Clients place bids (must exceed current bid + minimum increment)
4. Auto-bid system manages proxy bidding
5. When auction ends, highest bidder wins
6. Winner creates order request
7. Vendor accepts request
8. Order is confirmed and fulfilled
```

### **Workflow 3: Buy Now Purchase**
```
1. Client adds products to cart
2. Client proceeds to checkout
3. System creates order request (BUY_NOW type)
4. Vendor receives notification
5. Vendor accepts/refuses order request
6. If accepted, order is confirmed
7. Vendor updates fulfillment status
8. Client receives notifications at each stage
```

### **Workflow 4: Messaging**
```

2. System creates MessageThread
3. Both parties exchange messages
4. Real-time notifications via Pusher
5. Message history preserved in thread
```

- All actions logged in audit trail
- Store can be suspended by admin

### **Review Rules**
- Only clients can write reviews
- Reviews are moderated by admins
