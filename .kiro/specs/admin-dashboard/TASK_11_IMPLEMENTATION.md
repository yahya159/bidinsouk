## Integration Points

### Existing Systems

- Uses existing admin authentication middleware
- Uses existing Prisma schema and database

### Related Features
- Store approval/rejection integrates with existing vendor approval system
- Store management affects products and auctions
- Activity logs visible in activity logs section

## Testing Recommendations

1. **API Routes Testing:**
   - Test pagination with various page sizes
   - Test search with different queries
   - Test filters (status, seller)
   - Test create with valid/invalid data
   - Test update with partial data
   - Test delete with existing stores
   - Test approve/reject workflows
   - Verify activity logging for all operations

2. **UI Component Testing:**
   - Test StoresTable with empty data
   - Test StoresTable with large datasets
   - Test search and filter interactions
   - Test StoreForm validation
   - Test StoreForm with JSON fields
   - Test navigation between pages
   - Test confirmation dialogs

3. **Integration Testing:**
   - Create store → View detail → Edit → Delete flow
   - Pending store → Approve → Verify status change
   - Pending store → Reject → Verify status change
   - Search and filter → Navigate to detail
   - Create with invalid seller ID
   - Create with duplicate store name

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - Very long store names
   - Invalid JSON in form fields
   - Missing required fields
   - Network errors
   - Concurrent updates
   - Deleted seller references

## Known Limitations

1. **Logo Upload:**
   - FileInput component present but not functional
   - Logo upload/storage not implemented
   - Would require file upload API and storage solution

2. **Bulk Operations:**
   - Bulk approve/reject buttons present but not functional
   - Placeholder implementation shows info notification
   - Would require selection mechanism and batch API endpoints

3. **JSON Fields:**
   - Address, socials, and SEO are free-form JSON
   - No structured input forms
   - Requires manual JSON formatting
   - Could benefit from structured form builders

4. **Slug Conflicts:**
   - Slug generation is basic (lowercase + hyphens)
   - No automatic conflict resolution (e.g., appending numbers)
   - Returns error if slug exists

## Future Enhancements

1. **Logo Management:**
   - Implement file upload API
   - Add image storage (S3, Cloudinary, etc.)
   - Add image preview
   - Add image cropping/resizing

2. **Bulk Operations:**
   - Add row selection checkboxes
   - Implement bulk approve API
   - Implement bulk reject API
   - Add bulk delete
   - Add bulk status change

3. **Advanced Filtering:**
   - Date range filters
   - Multiple status selection
   - Seller multi-select
   - Product/auction count filters

4. **Structured Forms:**
   - Address form with street, city, state, zip fields
   - Social links with predefined platforms
   - SEO form with title, description, keywords fields

5. **Enhanced Detail View:**
   - Store analytics (views, conversion rate)
   - Revenue statistics
   - Customer reviews
   - Performance metrics

6. **Export Functionality:**
   - Export stores list to CSV
   - Export store details to PDF
   - Bulk export selected stores
