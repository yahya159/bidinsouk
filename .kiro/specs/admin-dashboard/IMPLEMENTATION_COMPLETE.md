## API Endpoints

All API endpoints are implemented under `/api/admin/`:

- `/api/admin/users` - User management
- `/api/admin/products` - Product management
- `/api/admin/auctions` - Auction management
- `/api/admin/orders` - Order management
- `/api/admin/stores` - Store management
- `/api/admin/activity-logs` - Activity log retrieval and export
- `/api/admin/analytics/*` - Analytics data
- `/api/admin/settings` - Platform settings
- `/api/admin/reports` - Abuse reports

## Database Schema Updates

Enhanced `AuditLog` model with:
- `ipAddress` field for IP tracking
- `userAgent` field for browser information
- `action` field for action type
- `metadata` field for additional context
- Indexes for performance

Added `PlatformSettings` model for configuration storage.

## Known Limitations

1. **Session Timeout**: Currently client-side only. Consider adding server-side session validation.
2. **Bulk Operations**: Limited to items on current page. Consider adding "select all" across pages.
3. **Export**: Currently supports CSV and JSON. Consider adding PDF and Excel formats.
4. **Real-time Updates**: Activity logs don't auto-refresh. Consider adding WebSocket support.
5. **Mobile Experience**: Some complex tables may need further optimization for mobile.

## Performance Considerations

- All tables use pagination (default 10 items per page)
- Activity logs use cursor-based pagination for efficiency
- Dashboard stats are cached (5-minute TTL recommended)
- Images are optimized with Next.js Image component
- Database queries use proper indexes
- Bulk operations are batched to prevent timeouts

## Security Considerations

- All routes protected with admin middleware
- All actions logged with IP addresses
- CSRF protection on all forms
- Input validation on all endpoints
- SQL injection prevention via Prisma
- XSS prevention via React
- Session timeout after inactivity
- Confirmation required for destructive actions
- Error messages don't expose sensitive information

## Maintenance

### Regular Tasks
- Monitor activity logs for suspicious activity
- Review and archive old activity logs
- Monitor system performance
- Update dependencies regularly
- Review and update platform settings as needed

### Monitoring
- Track API response times
- Monitor error rates
- Track user activity patterns
- Monitor database performance
- Track session timeout rates

## Support

For issues or questions:
1. Check the Integration Test Guide
2. Review implementation documentation for specific tasks
3. Check activity logs for error details
4. Review error boundary logs

## Conclusion

The admin dashboard is now fully implemented with all planned features. The system provides comprehensive management capabilities, robust security, excellent user experience, and detailed audit trails. 

The next phase is thorough testing using the Integration Test Guide, followed by any necessary refinements before production deployment.

**Status**: ✅ Implementation Complete - Ready for Testing
