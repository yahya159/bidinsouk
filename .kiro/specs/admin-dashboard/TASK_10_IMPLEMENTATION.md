## Technical Implementation Details

### Database Schema
Uses existing Prisma schema with Order model:
- Order status: CONFIRMED, REFUSED, CANCELED_AFTER_CONFIRM
- Fulfillment status: PENDING, PREPARING, READY_FOR_PICKUP, SHIPPED, DELIVERED, CANCELED
- Timeline stored as JSON for tracking all status changes
- Shipping information stored as JSON

### Activity Logging
All order management actions are logged:
- ORDERS_VIEWED - When admin views order list
- ORDER_VIEWED - When admin views order details
- ORDER_STATUS_UPDATED - When order status is changed
- ORDER_REFUNDED - When refund is processed

### API Response Format
```typescript
{
  id: string;
  number: string;
  total: number;
  status: string;
  fulfillStatus: string;
  shipping: any;
  timeline: any[];
  createdAt: string;
  user: {
    id: string;
    name: string;
    email: string;
  };
  store: {
    id: string;
    name: string;
    seller: {
      id: string;
      name: string;
      email: string;
    };
  };
}
```

### UI Components Used
- Mantine Table for data display
- Mantine Card for information sections
- Mantine Badge for status indicators
- Mantine Modal for dialogs
- Mantine Select for dropdowns
- Mantine Textarea for notes
- Mantine DatePickerInput for date filters
- Mantine Timeline for order history
- Mantine Pagination for navigation
- Mantine notifications for feedback

## Requirements Coverage

✅ **Requirement 5.1** - Paginated list of all orders with key details
✅ **Requirement 5.2** - Search and filter orders by multiple criteria
✅ **Requirement 5.3** - Full order details including items, payment, and shipping
✅ **Requirement 5.4** - Update order status with validation
✅ **Requirement 5.5** - Process refunds with reason tracking
✅ **Requirement 5.6** - Dispute resolution with notes

## Testing Recommendations

1. **API Endpoints:**
   - Test order listing with various filters
   - Test pagination with large datasets
   - Test status update validation
   - Test refund processing
   - Verify activity logging

2. **UI Components:**
   - Test table filtering and search
   - Test status update modal validation
   - Test refund modal with various inputs
   - Test responsive design on mobile
   - Test export functionality

3. **Integration:**
   - Test complete order management workflow
   - Test status transitions
   - Test refund process end-to-end
   - Verify timeline updates correctly
   - Test concurrent admin actions

## Known Limitations

1. Refund processing is simulated - needs integration with payment gateway
2. Export functionality is client-side only - consider server-side export for large datasets
3. No email notifications for status changes (can be added in future)
4. No order item details displayed (Order model doesn't include items in current schema)

## Next Steps

The order management implementation is complete. The next task in the spec is:
- Task 11: Store management enhancement
