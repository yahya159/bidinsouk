# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature introduces a comprehensive admin dashboard that provides system administrators with complete oversight and control over the platform. Unlike the client dashboard which focuses on user-specific data and actions, the admin dashboard serves as a centralized control panel for managing all platform resources including users, products, auctions, and system activities. The dashboard will include advanced monitoring capabilities with detailed user activity logs that track IP addresses and actions, enabling administrators to maintain security, audit user behavior, and manage the platform effectively.
