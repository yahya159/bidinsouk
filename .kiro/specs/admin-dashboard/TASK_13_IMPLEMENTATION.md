## Technical Implementation Details

### API Routes
- All routes protected with admin authentication
- Support for date range parameters (startDate, endDate)
- Default to last 30 days if no dates provided
- Calculate previous period for trend comparisons
- Use Prisma aggregations and raw SQL for complex queries
- Proper error handling and logging

### Chart Components
- Built with Recharts library
- Integrated with Mantine theme colors
- Responsive design for all screen sizes
- Customizable formatters for data display
- Support for multiple data series
- Interactive tooltips and legends

### Analytics Components
- Client-side components for interactivity
- Use StatsCard component for consistent metrics display
- Combine multiple chart types for comprehensive views
- Include both visual and tabular data representations
- Proper data formatting (currency, percentages, numbers)

### Analytics Page
- Server component wrapper for metadata
- Client component for interactivity
- Suspense boundary for loading states
- Date range filtering
- Export functionality for reports
- Tab-based navigation between analytics sections

## Data Flow

1. User selects date range on analytics page
2. Client component fetches data from all three API endpoints in parallel
3. API routes query database with date filters
4. Data is aggregated and trends calculated
5. Response includes current period data and comparison with previous period
6. Client components render charts and tables with the data
7. User can switch between tabs to view different analytics
8. User can export complete report as JSON

## Key Metrics Tracked

### User Analytics
- Total users, new users, active users
- Registration trends over time
- Role distribution (Client, Vendor, Admin)
- Engagement rate (active users / total users)
- Daily registration counts

### Revenue Analytics
- Total revenue, transaction count
- Commission earnings (10% of revenue)
- Average order value
- Daily revenue and transaction trends
- Revenue by store (top performers)
- Revenue by order status

### Product Analytics
- Total products, new products
- Product status distribution (Draft, Active, Archived)
- Product condition distribution (New, Used)
- Total views and average views per product
- Daily product creation trends
