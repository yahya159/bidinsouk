5. **Responsive Design**: Could add more mobile-optimized views for complex tables

## Conclusion

All sub-tasks for Task 16 have been successfully implemented. The admin dashboard now has:
- ✅ Session timeout handling with warnings
- ✅ Confirmation dialogs for all destructive actions
- ✅ Error boundaries with logging
- ✅ Comprehensive loading states and skeletons
- ✅ Responsive design for mobile/tablet/desktop
- ✅ Keyboard shortcuts and command palette
- ✅ All components integrated and ready for testing

The implementation follows Mantine design patterns, uses TypeScript for type safety, and integrates seamlessly with the existing admin dashboard architecture.
