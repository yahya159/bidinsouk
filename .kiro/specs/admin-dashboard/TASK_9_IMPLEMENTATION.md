| POST | /api/admin/auctions | Create new auction |
| GET | /api/admin/auctions/[id] | Get auction details |
| PUT | /api/admin/auctions/[id] | Update auction |
| DELETE | /api/admin/auctions/[id] | Delete auction |
| POST | /api/admin/auctions/[id]/extend | Extend auction |
| POST | /api/admin/auctions/[id]/end | End auction early |

## Requirements Coverage

All requirements from the design document have been met:

- ✅ 4.1 - List auctions with pagination, search, and filters
- ✅ 4.2 - Search and filter functionality
- ✅ 4.3 - View auction details with bid history
- ✅ 4.4 - Create new auctions
- ✅ 4.5 - Edit existing auctions
- ✅ 4.6 - Delete auctions
- ✅ 4.7 - Extend auction end time
- ✅ 4.8 - End auctions early
- ✅ Activity logging for all operations
- ✅ IP address tracking

## Testing Recommendations

1. **API Testing:**
   - Test pagination with various page sizes
   - Test all filter combinations
   - Test auction creation with valid/invalid data
   - Test auction updates with various field changes
   - Test auction deletion with and without bids
   - Test extend functionality with different durations
   - Test end early functionality for different statuses

2. **UI Testing:**
   - Test form validation
   - Test date picker validation
   - Test store/product selection flow
   - Test all action buttons
   - Test modals (extend, end, delete)
   - Test navigation between pages

3. **Integration Testing:**
   - Create auction → View → Edit → Delete flow
   - Test with multiple concurrent admins
   - Verify activity logs are created correctly
   - Test with auctions in different statuses

## Next Steps

Task 9 is complete. The next task in the implementation plan is:
- **Task 10:** Order management implementation

## Notes

- All components use Mantine v7 for consistency
- Activity logging captures IP addresses for security auditing
- Proper error handling and user feedback throughout
- BigInt serialization handled correctly for all database IDs
- Date validation ensures data integrity
