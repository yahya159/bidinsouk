## Integration Points

### Admin Sidebar
The activity logs link is already integrated in the admin sidebar:

- Label: "Activity Logs"
- Description: "View system activity"
- Route: `/admin-dashboard/activity-logs`

### API Endpoints Used
- `GET /api/admin/activity-logs` - List logs with pagination and filters
- `GET /api/admin/activity-logs/[id]` - Get single log details
- `GET /api/admin/activity-logs/export` - Export logs in CSV/JSON

### Dependencies
- Existing ActivityLogger service (`lib/admin/activity-logger.ts`)
- Existing API route (`app/api/admin/activity-logs/route.ts`)
- Mantine UI components (Table, Card, Drawer, etc.)
- Mantine Dates for date pickers
- date-fns for date formatting
- Next.js App Router for routing

6. Test pagination
7. Test expandable rows
8. Test export in both CSV and JSON formats
