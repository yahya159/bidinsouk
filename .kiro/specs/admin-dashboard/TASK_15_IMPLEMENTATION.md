## Data Flow

### Report Listing
1. User navigates to `/admin-dashboard/reports`
2. Page fetches reports from API with filters
3. API queries `AbuseReport` table with pagination
4. API enriches reports with target information (Product/Auction/User)
5. ReportsTable displays reports with filtering options
6. Activity logged: `REPORTS_VIEWED`

### Report Detail View
1. User clicks on a report
2. Navigate to `/admin-dashboard/reports/[id]`
3. Page fetches detailed report from API
4. API fetches report with all related data:
   - Reporter user details
   - Target content (Product/Auction/User)
   - Reported user (for products/auctions)
5. ReportDetailCard displays all information
6. Activity logged: `REPORT_VIEWED`

### Status Update & Action
1. Admin clicks action button (e.g., "Remove Content")
2. PUT request to `/api/admin/reports/[id]`
3. API updates report status
4. If action specified:
   - `remove`: Updates Product/Auction status to ARCHIVED
   - `suspend`: Logs action for manual user suspension
5. Activity logged: `REPORT_UPDATED` with metadata
6. Page refreshes to show updated status
7. Success notification displayed

## Database Schema

Uses existing `AbuseReport` model:
```prisma
model AbuseReport {
  id         BigInt      @id @default(autoincrement())
  reporter   User        @relation(fields: [reporterId], references: [id])
  reporterId BigInt
  targetType String      // "Product", "Auction", "User"
  targetId   BigInt
  reason     String
  details    String?
  status     AbuseStatus @default(OPEN)
  createdAt  DateTime    @default(now())
}

enum AbuseStatus {
  OPEN
  REVIEWING
  RESOLVED
  REJECTED
}
```

## Activity Logging

All report management actions are logged:
- `REPORTS_VIEWED`: When admin views report list
- `REPORT_VIEWED`: When admin views specific report
- `REPORT_UPDATED`: When admin updates report status or takes action

Logged metadata includes:
- Report ID
- Old and new status
- Action taken (remove, suspend)
- Filter parameters (for list views)

## Features

### Status Management
- **OPEN**: New reports requiring attention (high priority)
- **REVIEWING**: Reports under investigation
- **RESOLVED**: Reports that have been addressed
- **REJECTED**: Reports dismissed as invalid

### Actions
- **Mark as Reviewing**: Change status to indicate investigation
- **Resolve (No Action)**: Close report without taking action
- **Remove Content**: Archive the reported product/auction
- **Suspend User**: Flag user for suspension (requires manual follow-up)
- **Dismiss Report**: Mark report as rejected/invalid

### Filtering & Search
- Filter by status
- Filter by target type (Product/Auction/User)
- Search by reason or details text
- Pagination for large datasets

### User Experience
- Color-coded status badges
- Priority indicators for open reports
- Stats dashboard with quick filters
- Alert banner for pending reports
- Breadcrumb navigation
- Loading states
- Success/error notifications
- Responsive design

## Integration Points

### Navigation
- Added to AdminSidebar with IconFlag
- Accessible at `/admin-dashboard/reports`

### Related Pages
- Links to user profiles (`/admin-dashboard/users/[id]`)
- Links to product details (`/admin-dashboard/products/[id]`)
- Links to auction details (`/admin-dashboard/auctions/[id]`)

### Activity Logs
- All actions logged to AuditLog table
- Viewable in Activity Logs section
- Includes IP address and user agent

## Security

- Admin role verification on all API routes
- Session validation
- Activity logging for audit trail
- Confirmation for destructive actions (via UI)
- Input validation on status updates

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Report Listing**
   - Test pagination with various page sizes
   - Test filtering by each status
   - Test filtering by each target type
   - Test search functionality
   - Test with empty results

2. **Report Details**
   - Test with Product reports
   - Test with Auction reports
   - Test with User reports
   - Test with deleted target content
   - Test with missing reporter

3. **Status Updates**
   - Test each status transition
   - Test action execution (remove, suspend)
   - Test with invalid report ID
   - Test concurrent updates

4. **Activity Logging**
   - Verify all actions are logged
   - Verify IP addresses are captured
   - Verify metadata is complete

## Future Enhancements

1. **Bulk Actions**: Process multiple reports at once
2. **Auto-flagging**: Automatically flag suspicious content
3. **Report Analytics**: Trends and patterns in reports
4. **Email Notifications**: Notify users of report outcomes
5. **Report History**: Track all actions taken on a report
6. **User Suspension**: Implement actual user suspension functionality
7. **Appeal System**: Allow users to appeal report decisions
8. **Report Categories**: More granular categorization of abuse types
