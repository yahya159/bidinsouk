# Auction Management API Implementation

## 🎯 Overview

I've successfully implemented comprehensive auction management API endpoints and updated the frontend to use them. The auction management system now provides full CRUD operations, advanced filtering, bulk operations, and real-time capabilities.

## 📋 Implemented Features

### 1. Main Auction API (`/api/vendors/auctions`)

**GET** - List auctions with advanced filtering:
- ✅ Pagination (page, limit)
- ✅ Search by title, description, category
- ✅ Filter by status (DRAFT, SCHEDULED, ACTIVE, ENDING_SOON, ENDED, CANCELLED)
- ✅ Filter by category
- ✅ Date range filtering (dateFrom, dateTo)
- ✅ Price range filtering (minPrice, maxPrice)
- ✅ Sorting by multiple fields (createdAt, endTime, currentBid, bidCount, views, title)
- ✅ Comprehensive statistics calculation
- ✅ Role-based access control (vendors see only their auctions)

**POST** - Create new auction:
- ✅ Full validation with Zod schemas
- ✅ Business rule validation (reserve price, start time, etc.)
- ✅ Automatic status determination based on start time
- ✅ Support for auto-extend and extend minutes

### 2. Individual Auction Management (`/api/vendors/auctions/[id]`)

**GET** - Get auction details:
- ✅ Complete auction information
- ✅ Bid history with privacy protection
- ✅ Auction statistics (total bids, unique bidders, etc.)
- ✅ Anonymized bidder information for vendors
- ✅ Full details for admins

**PUT** - Update auction:
- ✅ Business rule validation (can't modify active auctions with bids)
- ✅ Automatic end time recalculation
- ✅ Comprehensive validation

**DELETE** - Cancel/Delete auction:
- ✅ Smart deletion (cancel active auctions, delete drafts)
- ✅ Business rule enforcement
- ✅ Proper status transitions

### 3. Auction Extension (`/api/vendors/auctions/[id]/extend`)

**POST** - Extend auction duration:
- ✅ Validation for active auctions only
- ✅ Maximum duration limits (30 days)
- ✅ Audit logging hooks
- ✅ Notification system hooks

### 4. Auction Cancellation (`/api/vendors/auctions/[id]/cancel`)

**POST** - Cancel auction with proper handling:
- ✅ Different rules for auctions with/without bids
- ✅ Admin override capabilities
- ✅ Bidder notification system
- ✅ Refund handling information
- ✅ Comprehensive audit logging

### 5. Bid History (`/api/vendors/auctions/[id]/bids`)

**GET** - Detailed bid history:
- ✅ Paginated bid history
- ✅ Privacy protection and anonymization
- ✅ Comprehensive bid statistics
- ✅ Admin-only detailed analysis
- ✅ Suspicious activity detection
- ✅ Device and timing analysis
- ✅ Peak bidding hours analysis

### 6. Bulk Operations (`/api/vendors/auctions/bulk`)

**POST** - Bulk auction operations:
- ✅ Bulk cancel with validation
- ✅ Bulk extend with business rules
- ✅ Export to CSV/JSON formats
- ✅ Bulk delete with proper validation
- ✅ Comprehensive error reporting
- ✅ Progress tracking and results summary

## 🎨 Frontend Updates
