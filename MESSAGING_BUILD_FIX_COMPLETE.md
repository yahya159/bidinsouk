# Messaging System Build Fix - Complete ✅

## 🎯 Problem Resolved
The build was failing with "Module not found: Can't resolve '@/components/messages/MessageThreadList'" and other missing component errors.

## 🔧 Solution Applied

### 1. Created Missing Component Files
- ✅ **MessageThreadList.tsx** - Complete thread list component with cards, badges, and interactions
- ✅ **ConversationView.tsx** - Full conversation interface with message bubbles and composer
- ✅ **MessageFilters.tsx** - Advanced filtering and search functionality  
- ✅ **MessageComposer.tsx** - Rich message composer with file attachments
- ✅ **CreateTicketModal.tsx** - Support ticket creation modal
- ✅ **CreateMessageModal.tsx** - Vendor message creation modal

### 2. Fixed Import Issues
- ✅ **Icon Import**: Replaced `IconMoreVertical` with `IconDots` (correct Tabler icon)
- ✅ **DatePicker**: Temporarily replaced `DatePickerInput` with `TextInput` (to be implemented later)
- ✅ **Auth Library**: Created `lib/auth.ts` with NextAuth configuration
- ✅ **Prisma Library**: Created `lib/prisma.ts` with Prisma client setup

### 3. Complete API Implementation
- ✅ **Threads API**: Full CRUD operations for message threads
- ✅ **Messages API**: Send, receive, and mark messages as read
- ✅ **Support Tickets**: Specialized API for support ticket creation
- ✅ **Attachments**: Secure file upload and management
- ✅ **Vendors API**: List active vendors for messaging

### 4. Real-Time Message Counts
- ✅ **useMessageCounts Hook**: Fetches real unread counts from API
- ✅ **MessageCountsContext**: Global state management for counts
- ✅ **Header Integration**: Shows actual unread counts instead of hardcoded values
- ✅ **Auto-refresh**: Updates counts when messages are sent/read
