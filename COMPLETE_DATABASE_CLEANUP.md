- **Offers**: 0 deleted âœ…
- **Watchlist items**: 0 deleted âœ…

   - Stores: 0 âœ…
```

## What Was Preserved

### ðŸ”’ **User Data (Intact)**
- **Users**: 3 preserved âœ…
- **Stores**: 2 preserved âœ…
- User accounts and authentication
- Store configurations and settings
- User profiles and preferences

### ðŸ”’ **System Data (Intact)**
- Database schema and structure âœ…
- Application configuration âœ…
- API endpoints and functionality âœ…
- Authentication system âœ…

## Key Fixes Applied

### **1. Removed Mock Data from Auctions API**
**Before:**
```typescript
// Mock data array with 5 hardcoded auctions
const mockAuctions = [...];
// API returned mock data instead of database
```

**After:**
```typescript
// Real database queries
const auctions = await prisma.auction.findMany({
  include: { product: true, store: true }
});
```

### **2. Database Cleanup Scripts**
Created comprehensive cleanup scripts:
- `scripts/complete-cleanup.ts` - Full database cleanup
- `scripts/check-database-status.ts` - Status verification
- `scripts/verify-cleanup.ts` - API endpoint testing

### **3. Proper Foreign Key Handling**
Cleanup performed in correct order:
1. Bids (references auctions)
2. Reviews (references products)
3. Watchlist items (references products)
4. Offers (references products)
5. Auctions (references products)
6. Products (base table)

## Current Database State

```sql
-- All clean tables
Products: 0 rows
Auctions: 0 rows
Bids: 0 rows
Offers: 0 rows
Watchlist: 0 rows
Reviews: 0 rows
Orders: 0 rows

-- Preserved tables
Users: 3 rows (preserved)
Stores: 2 rows (preserved)
```
