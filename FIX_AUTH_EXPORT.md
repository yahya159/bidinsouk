# Auth Export Fix ✅

## Issue

After updating the NextAuth route handler export structure, the home page and profile page were trying to import `auth` from the route file, which was no longer exported.

**Error:**
```
(0 , _app_api_auth_nextauth_route__WEBPACK_IMPORTED_MODULE_1__.auth) is not a function
at Home (app\page.tsx:6:29)
```

## Root Cause

The NextAuth route file was changed from:
```typescript
export const { 
  handlers: { GET, POST }, 
  auth, 
  signIn, 
  signOut 
} = NextAuth(authConfig)
```

To:
```typescript
const handler = NextAuth(authConfig)
export { handler as GET, handler as POST }
```

This removed the `auth` export that was being used by server components.

## Solution

Updated the imports in server components to use the `getSession()` helper from `lib/auth/session.ts` instead:

### Files Fixed

1. **app/page.tsx**
   - Changed: `import { auth } from '@/app/api/auth/[...nextauth]/route'`
   - To: `import { getSession } from '@/lib/auth/session'`
   - Changed: `const session = await auth()`
   - To: `const session = await getSession()`

2. **app/profile/page.tsx**
   - Changed: `import { auth } from '@/app/api/auth/[...nextauth]/route'`
   - To: `import { getSession } from '@/lib/auth/session'`
   - Changed: `const session = await auth()`
   - To: `const session = await getSession()`

## Why This Works

The `getSession()` helper in `lib/auth/session.ts` uses `getServerSession(authConfig)` which is the recommended way to get the session in server components:

```typescript
import { getServerSession } from 'next-auth'
import { authConfig } from './config'

export async function getSession() {
  return await getServerSession(authConfig)
}
```

## Other Files

Other API routes that were already using `getServerSession(authConfig)` directly continue to work fine:
- `app/api/cart/route.ts`
- `app/api/products/route.ts`
- `app/api/orders/route.ts`
- And many others...

## Status

✅ **Fixed and verified**

All files now compile without errors and the authentication system works correctly.

## Testing

1. Start the dev server: `npm run dev`
2. Visit `http://localhost:3000`
3. The home page should load without errors
4. Register and login should work
5. Profile page should display user data

## Best Practice

For server components and pages, always use:
```typescript
import { getSession } from '@/lib/auth/session'
const session = await getSession()
```

For API routes, use either:
```typescript
// Option 1: Direct import
import { getServerSession } from 'next-auth'
import { authConfig } from '@/lib/auth/config'
const session = await getServerSession(authConfig)

// Option 2: Use helpers
import { requireAuth } from '@/lib/auth/api-auth'
const user = await requireAuth(req)
```
